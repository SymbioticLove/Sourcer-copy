          If you need something with deeper functionality, we suggest our <a href="https://github.com/SymbioticLove/React-Flask-Boilerplate" alt="React-Flask-template" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">React/Flask framework</a>
          . We can deliver simple projects using this template in as little as a week! Everything is set up, including the :root css
          directory, which can be found in index.css. The included shortcuts, setup and run, will set up your Node environment and install
          npm and open and run the server, as long as you saved it at your C: drive and didn't change the name. For Mac and Linux
          users, you will need to modify the shortcuts to include your name in the paths.
